## TLDR

- A website that works as an aggregator for locations and points of interest to those who frequent the Algarve region.

- Its main goal is to have a clean and easy-to-use UI where users can easialy interact with the website and view locations based on category.

- It should be an alternative to the many blogs and indexes currently available online that are all very confusing and frustrating in terms of UI/UX.

### Inspiration

This was inspired by the amount of people that frequently ask me about the Algarve.

I decided to build something that would allow me to learn some new technologies and improve my skills in the process.

I hope this can be useful to others and to the community in general.
